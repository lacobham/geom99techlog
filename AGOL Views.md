## ArcGIS Online Layer Views

2024/03/28

- First I created a new Survey in Survey123 that had a field I would want to hide (email address). This also created a new feature layer, since there was a question in it asking the user to enter where they spotted a turtle.
- I excluded irrelevant or confidential fields (email address, creator, creation date, editor, edit date)
