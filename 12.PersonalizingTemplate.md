## Personalizing Template

2024/04/04

- After deploying the template in my repository I started editing it, specifically the 'Team' page
- I learned a new html command of 'fade-in', where you can make the background fade in every time the page is reloaded/visited
- I also spent a lot of time troubleshooting the template as there was some css that was not serving any purpose and would mess up the formatting at times
- This was the first time that I worked with a template, and I saw how easy it is to use and learn new things in HTML, CSS, and Javascript just from reading the code
- I also learned about 'featured posts', which highlights images in a grid and is easier to use in my opinion than image gallery
- Overall, I found that a template allows you to make a much more polished and professional looking site than hard coding the whole thing yourself like my group did in GEOM101
