## Final Dashboard

2024/03/28

- My group agreed that this week we would all create an ArcGIS Dashboard for our problem statement that used everything we learned and was as good as we could make it. This way we could all compare our Dashboards next week and see what we want to combine for our final submitted version.

My Dashboard: https://fleming.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/0d18f4c6b3fc4a28aa1cddb7ddca2e9e

- I first made a survey that would be embedded in the Dashboard
- The survey: https://survey123.arcgis.com/share/dc862566a7304900bb0dbff219d93f1f?portalUrl=https://Fleming.maps.arcgis.com

- I used what I learned aabout layer views to limit the study area to Ontario and hide fields, and I used what I learned about Dashboard widgets to add indicators, a chart, gauges, and embedded content (the survey).

- I learned that when making a gauge you can set different colours based on different threshold values, so I set these values to change when the average health value went up.
