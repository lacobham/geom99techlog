## GitHub Template

2024/04/02

1. After discussing with my group we agreed on using this template from HTML5 UP: https://html5up.net/massively

2. I created a new repository called 'web9' and added my group members as contributors.

3. Then, I downloaded the template and added it to the repository.

4. For about 30 minutes I was stuck on why the website was getting a 404 error when I tried to view it, but I eventually realized that it was because I didn't choose the main branch in the 'Pages' section of settings

5. While I knew this was the issue early on, I thought that online sources I went to for help were talking about choosing the main branch in the 'General' part of settings.

6. Now we will start editing this template as a group to meet all the requirements of the assignment and display our group solution.
