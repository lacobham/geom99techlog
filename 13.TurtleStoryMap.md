## Turtle StoryMap

2024/04/08

- After discussing with the team about what we wanted the StoryMap to look like, I used Affinity Designer to make the header (I did not log my time for this because it is not related to our web solution)

- I then made a custom theme called 'Turtles' that matched the bottom of the header image so the StoryMap would flow. I also changed the accent colour, added an SVG icon, and a custom separator (did not log the time drawing this)

- Then I did research on turtles in Ontario and started writing about them and citing my sources

- I made this map tour based on one of the sources to show where the most road mortalities occur

- I also embedded our Survery123 form and Dashboard

- One thing I could not figure out was how to adjust the size of an embed card's image

-Even after resizing the image itself it did not change, so I took it out altogether
